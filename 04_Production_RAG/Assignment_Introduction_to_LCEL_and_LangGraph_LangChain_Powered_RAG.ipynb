        "# Understanding LangChain Runnables and LCEL\n",
        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOllama` instance (running locally with Ollama)\n",
        "- **Prompt Templates**: Format inputs consistently\n",
        "- **Retrievers**: Get relevant context from a vector store\n",
        "- **Output Parsers**: Structure model outputs\n",
        "- **LangGraph Nodes**: Individual components in our graph\n",

        "#### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!\n",

        "> coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications\n",
        "\n",
        "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in our example here, we're focusing on a simpler `State` object:\n",
        "\n",

        "    response: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [Document(page_content=\"...some data...\")],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"The Eiffel Tower is about 324 meters tall...\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is\\nthe most prevalent use case for generative AI.9\\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,\\nwe show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,\\nand may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active\\nusers had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,\\nwith active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that\\nnearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps\\nhave narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively\\nfaster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and\\nusers in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is\\nseeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11\\nAsking is when the\\nuser is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving\\nmodels of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and\\nSchneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output\\nor perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.\\n(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or\\naction. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.\\nHowever, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing\\njob tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writing-\\nrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all\\nwhite-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by\\nemployers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of\\ngenerative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs\\nsuch as writing and software code.\\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network\\n(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that\\nabout 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,\\ndocumenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,\\nand thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage\\nare highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting\\nInformation and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in\\nnearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales\\noccupations.\\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT'),\n",

Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\\nmessages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching. Another\\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% of Practical Guidance - is general how-to advice on a variety\\nof topics. Technical Help includes Computer Programming (4.2% of messages), Mathematical Calcu-\\nlations (3%), and Data Analysis (0.4%). Looking at the topic of Self-Expression, only 2.4% of all\\nChatGPT messages are about Relationships and Personal Reflection (1.9%) or Games and Role Play\\n(0.4%).\\nWhile users can seek information and advice from traditional web search engines as well as from\\nChatGPT, the ability to produce writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products\\ndistinguishes generative AI from existing technologies.\\nChatGPT is also more flexible than web\\nsearch even for traditional applications like Seeking Information and Practical Guidance, because\\nusers receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy\\nfootball team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided\\ncontent and follow-up requests.\\nFigure 9: Breakdown of granular conversation topic shares within the coarse mapping defined in Table 3.

              "\n",
              "3. Writing Tasks: The relative frequency of writing-related conversations is notable. Writing is a common task in nearly all white-collar jobs, and AI's ability to produce long-form outputs such as writing and software code is a distinctive feature. \n",
              "\n",
              "4. Work Activities: About 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: obtaining, documenting, and interpreting information; and making decisions, giving advice, solving problems, and thinking creatively.\n",
              "\n",
              "5. User Intent: AI is used in different ways based on user intent, classified into Asking, Doing, or Expressing. Doing, which includes drafting an email, writing code, etc., constitutes nearly 56% of work-related queries. \n",
              "\n",
              "6. Technical Help: AI is also used for technical help, including writing code, debugging, explaining programming concepts, or discussing programming languages and tools.\n",
